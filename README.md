# Working on Arrhythmia
Cardiac Arrhythmia Diseases Prediction Model Based on Classification Algorithms.
The dataset is taken from UCI machine learning repository. The dataset consists of 452 rows corresponding to each patient. 279 attributes are recorded for each patient like age, weight, ECG related data, heart related data, QRS duration etc. There are sixteen classes associated with the dataset. Class 1 is corresponding to no arrhythmia and class 2 to 15 corresponding to different types of arrhythmia. Class 16 is corresponding to unlabeled patient. There are 245 rows corresponding to class 1 label, remaining 185 classes corresponding to 14 classes and 22 rows are unlabeled. So anyone can find the dataset at UCI machine learning repository.
