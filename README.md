# Cardiac Arrhythmia Diseases Prediction Model Based on Classification Algorithms.
It includes applying different machine learning algorithms but before that applying some feature selection technique as well to enhance results.

The dataset is taken from UCI machine learning repository. The dataset consists of 452 rows corresponding to each patient. 279 attributes are recorded for each patient like age, weight, ECG related data, heart related data, QRS duration etc.
